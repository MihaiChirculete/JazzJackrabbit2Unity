# Jazz Jackrabbit 2 Unity

Port of the Jazz Jackrabbit 2 game by EpicMegaGames written in C# for the Unity game engine.

(Work in progress)

# What currently works
    - Loading of tilesets (mostly, for some reason the images generated are purple)
    - Loading the level data and generating the tiles (mostly)
