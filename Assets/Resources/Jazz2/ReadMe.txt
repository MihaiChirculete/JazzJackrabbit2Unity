Direct X Setup Notes
--------------------

Jazz Jackrabbit 2 requires that DirectX 5 is installed on your
computer. If you do not have DirectX installed, the installation
program will guide you through the installation process. If you
have an older version of DirectX installed, the installation program
will ask you if you would like to upgrade to DirectX 5. If you
choose "Yes", the installation program will guide you through the
installation process. If you choose "No" you will be given a warning
that Jazz Jackrabbit 2 may not work correctly, and you may encounter
performance problems because you are not using the latest DirectX
drivers.

NOTE: IT IS STRONGLY RECOMMENDED THAT YOU INSTALL DIRECTX 5 ON
YOUR COMPUTER TO PLAY JAZZ JACKRABBIT 2. WE CANNOT OFFER TECHNICAL
SUPPORT TO PEOPLE WHO ARE USING OLDER VERSIONS OF DIRECTX.

                     Party Mode - Multiplayer Notes
=============================================================================

Selecting Custom Multiplayer Levels
-----------------------------------

When you setup an internet multiplayer server, you can choose one of your 
custom levels created with the Jazz Creation Station (JCS) as the start 
level. To do this, press ENTER on "Select a level" in the Game Server 
Setup Menu and type in the name of the level you wish to start on. If you
don't wish to start on a custom level, Jazz Jackrabbit 2 will automatically
start on the default start level for the Part Mode game type you've selected.


Talking to Other Players
------------------------

During an Internet game, you can 'talk' to all the players in the game, or 
'talk' to your team mates privately.

To start talking to all the players, press the "T" key on your keyboard.
Then, type in what you would like to say. Finish by pressing the ENTER
key. When you press ENTER, your text will be sent to all the other players
in the game. If you press "T" and decide you would rather not say anything,
press the ESC key to go back to the game.

In Capture The Flag, if you would like to talk in private with your team 
mates, press SHIFT+T. This way, you can talk about strategies with your 
team without your opponent listening. If you or one of your team mates types 
private text, the name will be displayed between the "[" and "]" brackets.


=============================================================================
                    Known Problems and Solutions
=============================================================================

- Jazz Jackrabbit 2 may produce unintended anomalies if a joystick or
  gamepad is removed during gameplay. If this happens, you should exit
  Jazz Jackrabbit 2, plug the joystick or gamepad back in, and restart
  the game before attempting to continue.


- In multiplayer mode, it may be possible for the players characters to
  get stuck if more than one character tries to access a spring at the
  same time. If this happens, you will have to start a new game to continue.

- In battle mode, it may be possible for the players characters to
  get stuck if more than one character tries to access a pole at the
  same time. If this happens, you should still be able to shoot. The game
  will continue when one of the stuck players gets killed.
