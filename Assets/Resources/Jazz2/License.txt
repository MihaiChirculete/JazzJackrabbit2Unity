This LIMITED SOFTWARE WARRANTY AND LICENSE AGREEMENT is a legal agreement 
between You and Epic MegaGames, Inc. and/or Project Two Interactive BV,

By opening the sealed software packet(s) and/or using the software, You are 
agreeing to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  If You do not agree to 
the terms of this Agreement, promptly return the unopened software packet(s)

This license Agreement permits You to use one copy of the software program(s) 
included in this package (the "SOFTWARE") on a single computer.  However, 
installation on a network server for the sole purpose of internal distribution 
shall not constitute "use" for which a separate license is required, provided 
You have a separate license for each computer to which the SOFTWARE is 
distributed. This license is not a sale of the original Software or any copy 
thereof.  Owner retains all right, title and interest to this Software and 
any related documentation, including (but not limited to) all copyrights, 
trademarks, trade secrets and patents, if applicable.  The Software is 
protected by United States copyright law and applicable copyright laws and 
treaties throughout the World.  

Other than as provided specifically in this Agreement, You are not permitted 
to copy or otherwise reproduce this Software; modify or prepare derivative 
copies based on the Software; distribute copies of the Software by sale or 
other transfer of ownership; rent, lease, or lend the Software; or to display 
the Software publicly.  You are expressly prohibited from transmitting this 
Software electronically over the Internet or through any other media or to 
any third party.  YOU ARE NOT PERMITTED TO REVERSE ENGINEER, DECOMPILE OR 
DISASSEMBLE THE SOFTWARE IN ANY WAY.  Any copying of the Software and related 
documentation not specifically allowed in this Agreement is a violation of 
this Agreement.  This Agreement ceases automatically (without any form of 
notice) if You do not comply with any Agreement provision.

Owner warrants that the original Storage Media holding the Software is free 
from defects in materials and workmanship under normal use and service for 
a period of ninety (90) days from the date of receipt.  If for any reason You 
find defects in the Storage Media, You may return the Software and all 
accompanying materials to the place You obtained it for a full refund.  Your 
exclusive remedies, and the entire liability of Owner, shall be  replacement
of any original Storage Media with the Software or  full refund of the price 
paid for this Software.

INCIDENTAL; OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES. Some states do not allow limitations 
on how long an implied warranty lasts, so the above limitation may not apply
