Mystic Legends Shouts:
=============================

We'd like to thank everyone who contributed to this level. Everyone who tested, gave us
level ideas and generally helped out gets a big pat on the back from us :) Special Thanks 
for this level go to Stephen MacLellan who gave us a couple of ideas which made the level
that much more enjoyable.

Shouts to everyone in the Jazz 2 community. There's too many of you to list but without
you guys & gals playing Jazz 2 non-stop, this wouldn't have been possible.

Until the next time...
