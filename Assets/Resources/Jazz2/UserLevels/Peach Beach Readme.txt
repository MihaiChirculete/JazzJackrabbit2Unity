        PEACH BEACH
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
Peach Beach is my 2nd single player level.  It uses the Beach 2 tile set and combines aspects of water and land play, along with an unlimited amount of eye candy to create the ultimate playing experience. The first level I created using JCS was Carrot Cream, which was one of the few lucky levels to be posted on The Daily Carrot, the official Jazz 2 web site. (www.jazzjackrabbit.com) Included with this ZIP file is a clone of that level. (Carrot Cream Clone)  Since both Carrot Cream and it's clone are almost exactly the same, I would recommend that you play Carrot Cream Clone on the Hard difficulty level.
