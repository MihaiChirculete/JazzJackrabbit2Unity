Another CTF?  Why, certainly!  Back in the lab, even?  Why not?

That ended up being my thoughts on this level.  After NUCS, I didn't have much of an urge to make
more Party Mode levels until I made some Single-Player madness.  Unfortunately, I gave up on
my first Single-Player level pretty quick (Plotless Pursuit is still in the back of my mind...
I might pick it up later), and started on, you guessed it, another Party Mode level.  I
realized just how much fun it was to host Spamtasia.

This, like JYTL, was going to be a battle.  I even made it small so it would make a good battle.
But, it seemed too... well... unfulfilling.  So, I chucked in a couple bases, and there it was.
And it STILL seems pretty big, even though it's smaller than either of my other CTFs.  The
level's relative size, however, makes it quite playable for only 4 players.  6 to 8 is kinda the
limit, then it gets too crowded.

I love the lab's tileset.  I love the lab's music.  So, I re-entered the lab for this shot.

I decided to not have as many hooks sitting around this one as in JYTL.  Someone told me that all
the hooks I plopped in there kinda made it hard to move around quickly.  I agreed... now, the
only hooks in there are in case I stupidly made a jump too high... heh... 

Stay tuned... Coming next is a race level...

Trivia:

Ah, you know you want to do it... cheat and read the sign above the second coin warp target.

See the cucumber/eggplant combination around the coin warp?  That's another trademark of mine,
other than my signature text.

When this level was originally hosted, my computer kept crashing.  Resetting, in fact.  Darndest
thing I ever seen...

Barq's Rootbeer has caffeine.  Lots of it, in fact.

What level of mine would be complete without the bouncy bullet powerup?  It's in the dark room,
around (62,43) is the breakable wall.

The ammo room?  It's also in the dark room.  I'm not telling, though... heh...

This was hosted with some members of the JMMB as a server test (See trivia point 3).  CTFs are
STILL fun!
