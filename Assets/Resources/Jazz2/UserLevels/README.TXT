Hello! and thanks for not only downloading Diamond DASH, but for
actually taking the time to read the readme!

Ok, some info:  I worked super-hard on this level, so I really hope
you enjoy it!  Please note that it is kind of a difficult level, with
some rather hard jumps.  Also, there are a total of 3 shortcuts, but
using one of them eliminates one other.  Any feedback of any sort is
greatly apprectiated.

If you have it on low detail it should look great but take a minute
to put it on high and check out all the layers, 'specially the
background at the end!


<>--INSTRUCTIONS--<>

There are a couple of ways to use the level.  1st you obviously need
to copy the whole zip file contents into your Jazz2 directory.  Then
if you wanna play it online: (at least until epic adds an online race
mode :)


<>--ONLINE PLAY--<>

Simply start a treasure (or battle/CTF if you wanna be able to die)
game using the level "ddash2". easy as that.


<>--OFFLINE PLAY--<>

Little more complicated.  This will add Diamond DASH as the 4th race
level. (you need to have it in your jazz2 directory, of course)

1st. Rename the file in the Jazz2 directory "race3.j2l" to "race3b.j2l".

2nd. Rename the level in the zip package "race3n.j2l" to "race3.j2l".

That wasn't too hard now, was it?  If for some absurd reason you want it out of the loop, just reverse the renamings. (make sure you do it in order though, don't wanna overwrite anything)
