HI!

Here is yet another tileset for Jazz Jackrabbit 2. Quite different from the
original idea, but somehow it worked out. This time there are two versions,
since some might prefer a less psychedelic choice of colours.
There are also two Treasure Hunt levels (the same, just using both colour 
variations) I added to try it out.

A few tips:

- Use those big spheres (or whatever) with care, since you might get stuck
  in certain arrangements. I added a mask that partly prevents that, but
  still it is not a 100% solution. Please direct further complaints
  to Epic (...)
- There are enough tiles for the big bubbles (or whatever) to have one solid
  and one transparent set.
- You have to make use of Layers 3 and 4 to get some nice overlay-effects
  and for the sucker tube entrances.
- Take a look at the demolevel(s) (meztrs01/02). They provide the
  animations, examples for destructable scenery and show how to have solid
  and transparent orbs (or whatever).
- Finally, remember those who play in lower resolutions (like 320x400)!!!
